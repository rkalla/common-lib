Changelog
---------
2.1
	* Added AbstractRetryableTask; an Callable<V> implementation that can 
	automatically retry failed tasks up to a configurable amount of times, 
	sleeping the executing Thread a configurable (increasing) duration every 
	subsequent time the task fails. This is fantastic for cloud-based/API or 
	data-store operations that may frequently fail and retrying them is not
	uncommon (e.g. Using Amazon Web Services APIs).

2.0
	* Fixed bug in build script where library required Java 6. It now works under
	Java 5 now.
	
	* Added RandomUtils class. Convenience methods for generating random numeric
	and character values (e.g. for password or unique file names).
	
	* Added ArrayUtils "NoCheck" methods for all major index searches and equals
	methods. These methods do NO pre-condition check. Handy when the utils class
	is being used inside of another utils class that does all the pre-condition
	checking already and don't want to incur any overhead.
	
	* Added ArrayUtils.append methods
	
	* Added ArrayUtils.insert methods
	
	* Added ArrayUtils.indexAfter methods to find the first index after the given
	value(s). Essentially skipping all values in array that match the value list
	provided, and finding the first non-matching index after the group.
	
	* Modified the ordering of arguments in library to more closely match the
	sequence implied by language.
	
	For example, when you see the method "indexOf(char c, chars[] array, int i)"
	you can read that out loud as: "Find the indexOf 'c', in 'array' starting
	at index 'i'".
	
	Previously the ordering was arbitrary and non-uniform across the library. To
	help improve the intuitiveness of the library and unify the style, it was
	changed.
	
	* Test coverage for all new methods and classes added.
	
	* Integrated into production in the CloudFront Log Parser project.

	* Integrated into production in the common-parser-lib project.

Description
-----------
A collection of hand-tuned, low-overhead classes used by most of the open source
and commercial software from The Buzz Media.

Many of the operations performed by this library (like searching an array for
a byte or char, or parsing a non-float number) are performed by other libraries
readily available from projects like Apache Commons; this functionality is
re-implemented in this library with a tight focus on performance and lower 
memory overhead at the expense of code duplication.

What that means is avoiding extremely deep method call-hierarchies for something
like indexOf(char[], char) calling down into a more specific method, then
another and another and another until finally ending up at some Abstract class
base implementation.

Benchmarks are provided to compare the library's performance to that of more
"standard" methods.


Performance
-----------
Benchmarks can be found in the /src/test/java folder and can be run directly
from the command line (no need to setup JUnit).

[Platform]
* Java 1.6.0_24 on Windows 7 64-bit 
* Dual Core Intel E6850 processor
* 8 GB of ram

[Benchmark Results]
indexOf byte		elapsed time: 12ms	(3,328,000 bytes scanned)
indexOf byte[]		elapsed time: 22ms	(3,328,000 bytes scanned)
indexOfAny byte[]	elapsed time: 23ms	(3,328,000 bytes scanned)

JDK Integer.parseInt 			elapsed time: 72ms	(1310720 numbers parsed, 6553600 bytes processed)
common-lib NumberUtils.parseInt elapsed time: 55ms	(1310720 numbers parsed, 9175000 bytes processed)


** A note about the Integer.parseInt comparison; the time required to read in the
sample file, decode it from byte[] to char[] and then convert those all into
String instances IS NOT INCLUDED in the benchmark timing. If you were to include
that, you would see both the  memory usage and CPU time of using 
Integer.parseInt to be significantly higher than NumberUtils.parseInt.


Runtime Requirements
--------------------
None.

There are currently no 3rd party dependencies required to use common-lib.


History
-------
While working on a few disparate projects (high performance XML parser,
Redis DB driver, CloudFront log parser, etc.) I noticed a pattern in the types
of utilities I was writing over and over again OR logic I was inlining directly
in my code.

I generalized this code and broke it out into this library so the handful of
projects maintained by The Buzz Media could more easily make use of the code.

I decided to open source the project because there is no proprietary magic in
any of this, the library is tuned to be fast with a small memory footprint and
I thought others might find it handy as opposed to using more bloated libs like
Apache Commons.
